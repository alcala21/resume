Expertise:
Multivariate Statistical Analysis; Machine Learning; Control, Optimization and Monitoring of HVAC Systems; Data Analytics and Visualization; Research and Application Development

Experience:
Full time:
2017 – 2020: Johnson Controls International - Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Principal Research Engineer.
• I worked in the development and implementation of advanced methods to improve the efficiency of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. I used traditional and modern optimization methods, as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to achieve the business goals of the projects. I was also involved in the transfer of newly developed technology into products and applications.

2015 – 2017: Johnson Controls International - Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Senior Research Engineer
• I developed methods for monitoring the performance of PID con- trollers, to detect steady state operation of HVAC equipment, and reduce energy consumption in wireless thermostats while keep- ing acceptable comfort standards. I used advanced mathematical tools to develop these methods, as well as artificial intelligence, machine learning and traditional statistical methods.

2013 – 2015: Johnson Controls BE Servicios - Mexico City, Mexico.
Senior Research Engineer
• Developed data-driven methods for fault detection and diagnosis in connected chillers.

2011 – 2013: Johnson Controls, Inc Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Senior Research Engineer
• Developed a method for adaptive sampling of PID controllers.

Internships
2010: The Dow Chemical Company - Freeport, Texas
Summer Research Intern
•Developed an Excel application for multivariate statistical monitoring of continuous and batch processes.

2006, 2007, 2009: Capstone Technology - Seattle, Washington 2007
Summer Engineering Intern
•Developed a multivariate image analysis application to monitor combustion efficiency in furnaces.
• Developed a PLS application for statistical modeling of chemical processes.
• Developed a PCA application for detection and diagnosis of sensor and process faults.

2008: NMC North Microelectronics - Beijing, China
Summer Engineering Intern
• Developed a PCA application for monitoring the operation of a semiconductor manufacturing process.
