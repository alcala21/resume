\opening{Dear Hiring Manager:}

I am looking for an opportunity to work as a Data Scientist in your organization. My educational background, work experience and continuous learning have provided me with a unique set of skills that make me a Data Scientist experienced in different domains. I can streamline the gathering, cleaning, modeling, analysis and visualization of large amounts of data in order to make appropiate business decisions. Furthermore, due to my analytical skills, I can adapt machine learning algorithms to the specific needs of your organization.

I am very experienced with R and several of its packages, and have experience with the Python programming language. I am familiar with several statistics and machine learning techniques to build descriptive and predictive models, and, as a visual person, I can handle several tools to create visualizations and tell compelling stories with data.

I am a self-motivated person with great analytical and modeling skills due to my PhD in Chemical Engineering. I have also very good interpersonal skills that allow me to connect with people and collaborate with them effortlessly. Furthermore, I am a quick learner that can get up-to-speed quickly with new methods, tools and concepts.

I'm looking forward to working with you.

\closing{
  \flushright Yours Sincerely\\
   Carlos F. Alcal\'a}
